# 🧑‍💻 Test Java

This repository contains my **Java practice programs**, written while learning **Java from basics to advanced concepts**.  
The goal of this repo is not to be a polished library, but a **learning playground** where I experiment with different Java features.

## 📌 About This Repository
- Covers **core to advanced Java topics** step by step.  
- Contains **essential programs** that helped me understand concepts clearly.  
- Some programs may look a little *messy by design* — I intentionally tried different variations to learn better.  
- Only **necessary examples** are uploaded here (not every experiment), so that the repo stays clean and useful.
